## Creator's Message

This is a sulthanauliya.com repo which serves as the source code to my website [sulthanauliya.com](https://www.sulthanauliya.com). I made this as a side project as well as to showcase my work, design, and what I create over the years. I use GatsbyJS as it is one of the popular stack to build a static web page these days.
