## Creator's Message

This is a sulthanauliya.com repo which serves as the source code to my website [sulthanauliya.com](https://www.sulthanauliya.com). I made this as a side project as well as to showcase my work, design, and what I create over the years. I use GatsbyJS as it is one of the popular stack to build a static web page today. 

## Why I choose GatsbyJS

The advantage of building your website in GatsbyJS is to utilise React JS library into your website but with a better SEO capabilities since Gatsby JS prints out static HTML onto the page and does not put your app into a single JS script like create-react-app does.
